Overview:
This project is a Flask-based web application that detects and highlights specific words in images using computer vision techniques. It supports both English and Nepali text, leveraging OpenCV for image preprocessing, word extraction, and template matching. The system processes uploaded images, identifies regions containing a specified search word, and returns base64-encoded images showing the processing stages and final results with highlighted matches. A testing framework evaluates performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics based on ground truth data.
Features

Multilingual Support: Handles English and Nepali text with appropriate font selection.
Image Preprocessing: Converts images to binary (black background, white foreground) and applies smudging for robust word extraction.
Word Extraction: Uses connected components analysis to identify word regions efficiently.
Template Matching: Supports multiple methods (TM_SQDIFF_NORMED, TM_CCOEFF_NORMED, SIFT) with dynamic thresholding.
Web Interface: Flask API for uploading images and search words, returning processed images and match coordinates.
Testing Framework: Evaluates detection accuracy using IoU-based metrics on a ground truth dataset.
